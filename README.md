# Seasonal To-Do List

This project is a simple [**Seasonal To-Do List**](https://mikewu1120.github.io/seasonal_todo_list/seasonal_todo_list.html) application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks based on different seasons (spring, summer, fall, and winter). Tasks are displayed as color-coded cards based on the selected season. The app also provides a corkboard background for a visually engaging interface.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Users can add tasks by specifying the task title, description, and season category (spring, summer, fall, or winter).
- **Edit Tasks**: Tasks can be edited by clicking the edit button. Changes to the title, description, and season can be made.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks by clicking the delete button on each task card.
- **Season Filtering**: Tasks can be filtered by selecting a specific season from a dropdown menu. The user can choose to display all tasks or only those from a specific season.
- **Task Rearrangement**: Tasks can be moved left or right on the board by using the left and right arrow buttons, giving users flexibility in the task arrangement.
- **Task Details View**: Clicking on a task card displays detailed information, including the task's title, season, description, creation date, last edited date, and last accessed date.
- **Hover Interactions**: The delete, edit, and rearrange buttons only appear when a task card is hovered over, ensuring a clean and minimal interface.
